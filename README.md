# FreeBSD CUPS Driver for EPSON TM-H6000IV Multifunction Printer

A CUPS driver for EPSON TM-H6000IV on FreeBSD.

It could run with other EPSON impact and receipt model too, but I can not test since I do not have those printers.

It does not work on endorsement mode (ECR-43B).

This code is ported from EPSON ImpactReceipt-3.0.0.0.

Dependency: clang, cups, make

Build method (root user might be required): ./build.sh & ./install.sh

Have fun.
